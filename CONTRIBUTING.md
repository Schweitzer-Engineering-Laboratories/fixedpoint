# Contributing to fixedpoint

A sincere __thank you__ for your interest in contributing - one of the primary
reasons this was open-sourced in the first place was to have community
involvement.

## Bugfix/Feature/Documentation Requests

Bugs, feature requests, and documentation requests are tracked as
[GitHub issues][1]. Before creating an issue, review existing open issues to
avoid duplication. 

* If the issue exists, either add a thumbs up reaction :+1: or add a comment
  with your specific use case.
* If the issue does not exist, create one. A moderator will respond in a timely
  manner.

## Fixing Bugs and Correcting Documentation

If you want to fix bugs yourself, fork the repository, make the changes, and 
submit a pull request (PR) with your changes (the [wiki][] explains how to do 
this in more detail). Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem(s)
and solution(s). Include the issue number (if there is not one, please create
one).

## Adding Features/Documentation

If you want to add features and/or documentation, fork the repository, make the
changes, and submit a pull request (PR) with your changes (the [wiki][] explains
how to do this in more detail). Ensure the PR description clearly describes the
changes  you made. Include the issue number (if there is not one, please create 
one).

## Releases

* [Pre-releases][2] are primarily to verify expected behavior. Pre-releases are
  followed shortly thereafter with a normal release. 
* All releases must have an entry in the [changelog][3].
* Documentation changes without code changes do not justify a release.
